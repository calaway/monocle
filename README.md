Monocle is an internal application for the Turing School community. It is a tool to make a directory of tech companies more useful for job seekers. It can be accessed with a TuringSchool Slack account at [TuringMonocle.HerokuApp.com](https://turingmonocle.herokuapp.com)

This application was created with the intention of being used with a Postgres database.
Setup:
```
rake db:create  
rake db:migrate
```
Further setup options may come later after the dataset has been fully implemented.
